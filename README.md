## Description

[From Karumi](https://github.com/Karumi/MaxibonKataIOS)

Getting started
Karumi developers love ice cream. And one of our favorites ice cream is named Maxibon:

Maxibon

Summer is coming and our small team sometimes needs Maxibons to work better. But in the Karumi HQs finding a Maxibon is not always easy. We start every week with 10 Maxibons but once there are just 2 Maxibons or less we need to buy more.

Karumi developers can consume zero or a positive number of maxibons. The Karumi team is composed of five engineers and everytime some of these engineers go to the kitchen they grab some maxibons as follows:

If the developer is Pedro, he grabs three maxibons.
If the developer is Davide, he does not grab any maxibon.
If the developer is Alberto, he grabs one maxibon.
If the developer is Jorge, he grabs two maxibons.
If the developer is Sergio, he grabs one maxibon.
When a Karumi engineer goes to the kitchen, they can go in a group if needed, and if there are just 2 maxibons or less left he has to send a message through the Slack API saying "Hi guys, I'm <NAME OF THE DEVELOPER>. We need more maxibons!". And the number of maxibons available will be automatically incremented by 10 :). If the number of maxibons left is lower than the number of maxibons the developer tries to get he will get just the number of maxibons available.
